# Chapter 1

- Install Devasc VM
- Linux:

Use the ls command to display a listing of the current directory. Remember that commands are casesensitive

Use the ls command with the labs argument to display the contents of the labs folder.

Use the ls command with the -l option to display a "long display" of the contents of the current directory.

Use the ls command with the -r option to display the contents of the current directory in reverse
alphabetical order.

Multiple options can be used at the same time. Use the ls command with both the -l and -r options to
display the contents of the current directory both in long and reverse order.

There are many more options that can be used with the ls command. Use the man command with the
argument ls to see all of the possibilities in the manual. The man command can be used to look up any
command within the system. Use the space bar to advance to subsequent screens. Press q to quit.

You can also use --help argument after most commands to see a shorter summary of all the available
command options.

Use the pwd command to display the current working directory

Use the cd command to change the directory to /home/devasc/Documents

Use the cd command with the / symbol to change directories to the root directory. Use pwd again to see
that you are now in the root directory.

Use the sudo command to issue a single command as the root user. A new terminal will not be created.

Use the sudo apt-get update command to update to refresh the list of available packages installed on
the VM. This command will not work without using the sudo command.


Use the ls Desktop -l to display the contents of the Desktop folder.
devasc@labvm:~$ ls Desktop -l

cd Documents/
echo "ls ../Desktop" > myfile.sh
cat myfile.sh
./myfile.sh #Run the script
ls -l myfile.sh
chmod +x myfile.sh
sudo chown root myfile.sh

mv myfile.sh /home/devasc/Desktop/
mv myfile.sh myfile_renamed.sh
cp myfile_renamed.sh myfile_renamed_and_copied.sh
rm myfile_renamed_and_copied.sh
